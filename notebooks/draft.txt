E.g., f(m,a,b,p) = a + b*m if p=0; f(m,a,b,p) = (a + b)*m if p=1
a in range(xxx), b in range(xxx), m in range(xxx)
Put sliders for a,b,m and a box for p (0 or 1)
Show the plots a vs f(m,a,b,p) for fixed choice of m,b,p (sliders/box)
Show the plots b vs f(m,a,b,p) for fixed choice of m,a,p (sliders/box)
Show the plots m vs f(m,a,b,p) for fixed choice of a,b,p (sliders/box)
(always accessing the already run results)
